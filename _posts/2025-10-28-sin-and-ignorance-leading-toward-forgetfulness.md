> Numbers 15:25 

> And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the
children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and
they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

Our sin is based on the idea that we wanted the tree of knowledge for wisdom. Our desire to be as gods when we were made in the image of God is corruption. We are ignorant because we are knowing and then not knowing by pride.

> Genesis 2:17

> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

Let's look at sin. The sin is all action that is against the work of God. Working against God we hinder his production and work. Who are we to do this?

> Genesis 3:3-7

> 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
  
> 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

> 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

> 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

> 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.


We are the seed of the first man, Adam, and we are the seed of Noah, after the great flood. Today we are degenerate and corrupt beings leaving paradise, we were living 900 years and dying 6000 years ago. Today our modern dream worlds of gaming, fantasy, pornography, pharmaceutical superstition and sorcery are the bleeding edge of atrophy. We have called our secular trek evolution but we barely live beyond 90 years.

> Genesis 5:5

> And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.

Hear the cries of the sophisticated man? He wants to never die, or he gives up it all for an Irish wake. He wants health care and population control. Secular nonsense is his wisdom.

In the study of the King James Bible we enter into an adventure that remits us to salvation. We find actual awakening into the work of the LORD. We get revival. We get our mind and brain physically transformed from trans-humanist lies to born again through Jesus Christ.
