How do we do great work without the blessing of Jesus Christ? It is not possible. We hereby dedicate all of our work. writing, art, publishing, music and contract whims to the Lord Jesus Christ. All of our good work and all of our nonsense we give to Jesus as he can heal by being the Great Physician. 

> Matt 9:10-13

> 10 Â¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. 

> 11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? 
 
> 12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. 

>13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 

Can we take OGFOMK and repurposed it as a blessing? Can we make this a vehicle for His namesake? Can we make a business or a ministry from speaking and writing about the wrong direction we are going? Can we also write about the good direction people are moving in?

One Giant Fart on Mankind should be repurposed. The attempt at renaming has been done before. Let's do it again. Let us pray. Let us bow our heads and pray, We pray that the LORD will allow a new name to come from the old draught as fertilizer into the garden.

> Matthew 15:17-19

> 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth
into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
 
> 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart;
and they defile the man.
 
> 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:


## One God For Our Man Kind

## Our God For Our Man Kind

In our traditional OgFOMK logo the "g" was made small in order to separate the acronym from others. Also the little "g" looked nice when it was in a certain font. By no means are we saying that "g" is deprecating GOD and we are also not saying that we represent GOD. We are the servants of the LORD who is the Triune GOD - THE FATHER - THE SON and THE HOLY SPIRIT. We are the servants of the LORD Jesus Christ and we bow to him only!

Our logo is a legacy and we are moving into removing the fetters of our acts of abomination toward greater acts of testimony and service. Let us tell the truth about where we have been and where we are going.

Below is the Original Cover of Issue #1. What a mess! To say that this is embarrassing is an understatement but to also say that the demonic elements were also not there and that it was just mere blasphemy is also not true. This was a cover that our testimony can joyfully reject. We also don't need to hide. Through Jesus Christ we are healed and we are forgiven. Not because of what we did, but because of what he, Jesus Christ, did for us!

> Philippians 4:6-7

> 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
  
> 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
