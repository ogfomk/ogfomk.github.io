How much money is there in this world? The answer is provided by those with divers measures. The fiat currency has no denominator. The LORD who is the master of measure must readjust the price because the resources are what the money buys and they, the resources, do not lie, unless they are measured diversely also.

> Deuteronomy 25:13-15

  > 13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
  
  > 14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.
  
  > 15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

Inflation is the unlimited money numerator printed in order to circumnavigate price discovery. One more thing that the praying man may understand is that this skill in precise measure affords him the blessing of the LORD in money. Not necessarily in wealth but in the understanding of what divers measures are and also in not laying up treasure that is immeasurable. 

> Matthew 6:19-21

  > 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
  
  > 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
  
  > 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
