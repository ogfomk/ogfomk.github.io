Today we are separated from the devil, and his people, who deserve only a lower case spelling as their folly is the fallow ground that is not cultivated through the blood of Jesus Christ. The LORD's people are separated from others by two things. one thing is in obedience and the second thing is by grace. We are not saved by our obedience! We are saved by grace and then we strive for obedience, by our free will, for the love of God. There is an order known by God and observed by man but the LORD, himself, tells us that these are his people. Even the stranger becomes one of the chosen when the stranger obeys God's law.

> Exodus 12:49

  > 49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
sojourneth among you.

> Exodus 23:9

  > 9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a
stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

To sum up what the separation is, These are the people with whom God loves because they do what he asks them to do, most of the time. God is the loving and wise God because he is the only one capable of doing this. Even when his people are stiff necked he does this. He also will severely punish those who disobey. When you read the The King James Bible you will understand that God witnesses a whole lot of nonsense before he chastises.

> Deuteronomy 31:27

  > 27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive
with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more
after my death?

Moses knew his people, who, were, and are, the LORD's people. They are the same as us but they are chosen because this is the seal and protection of the Word of God. Now, the Gentile, *Ethnos*, and the Jew are separated only as sons of Adam and sons, born again through Jesus Christ. By no means is this a precise description but it is an attempt at understanding the separation that is divine only and not merely genetic, familiar or cultural. 

Your best bet is to read your Bible, and get to know through the scripture, what is and is not true. Also, bend your knee and pray for Jesus Christ to be your advocate. He will do this. His blood has been shed already for everyone who will accept it.
