OgFOMK ArTS was started in 1987. We published a 'zine in 1988 through the mid 2000s very infrequently. We published music, papers, documents and web content. We also have been involved in various business entities regarding construction, arts and letters. 

We claimed in the past to be agnostic, atheist, spiritual and other paths that were wide and filled with garbage. Our writing and work is nothing original. If anything it is the path of the spiritually bankrupt seeking a truth that is not manufactured by today's or yesterday's society. 

Warts and all we seek, now, only to be in the service of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We give all glory to Jesus Christ who has done more for us than we could ever imagine. 

All Bible Quotes are from the Authorized King James Version unless otherwise noted.
